                <p>
                    In this section, I’ll be showcasing some of the projects I’ve worked on, detailing the inspiration behind them, how I built them, and the coding languages I used. 
                    These projects were created out of curiosity, a desire to solve problems, and the fun of experimenting with new technologies.

                <h2>Funkin-Definitive-Edition</h2>
                <p>
                    My project, Funkin' Definitive Edition, was created on August 12, 2022. 
                    Friday Night Funkin's original engine contained a lot of bugs and errors at that time, and playing was frustrating. 
                    Because I was bored and wanted to improve the experience, I decided to fix these bugs and implement my own modifications to improve the game. 
                    I wrote this project in <strong>Haxe and HaxeFlixel</strong>, which allowed me to modify and optimize the game engine successfully.

                <h2><strong>Legbot Host</strong></h2>
                <p>
                    Another project, LegbotHost, was a Discord bot that I made with my friend <a title="colorlol" href="https://github.com/colorlol" class="colorlol" target="_blank"><strong>Tamesh</strong></a> during the 2021 pandemic. 
                    We were spending so much time on Discord with not much else going on, so we figured we'd learn <strong>Node.js</strong> and create a bot that could tell jokes, display the weather, and even generate images of pets. 
                    It was an awesome learning experience and a good time that helped us improve our coding skills. 
                    Though I did cease to develop the bot sometime in 2022, it was a fantastic learning experience about how to go about developing bots and dealing with real-time APIs.
