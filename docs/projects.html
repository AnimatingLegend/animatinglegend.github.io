                    In this section, I'll be showcasing some of the projects I've worked on, detailing the inspiration behind them, how I built them, and the coding languages I used. 
                    These projects were created out of curiosity, a desire to solve problems, and the fun of experimenting with new technologies.

                    My project, Funkin' Definitive Edition, was created on August 12, 2022. 
                    <a title="Friday Night Funkin Old Github Repo" href="https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin/tree/legacy/0.2.x" class="FNF" target="_blank"><strong>Friday Night Funkin's original engine</strong></a> contained a lot of bugs and errors at that time, and playing was frustrating. 
                    Because I was bored and wanted to improve the experience, I decided to fix these bugs and implement my own modifications to improve the game. 
                    I wrote this project in <strong>Haxe and HaxeFlixel</strong>, which allowed me to modify and optimize the game engine successfully.

                <p>
                    Two projects in the same category, <strong>Legbot-Host, and Colorbot-host</strong>. 
                    Legbot-host was a Discord bot that I made with my friend <a title="colorlol" href="https://github.com/colorlol" class="colorlol" target="_blank"><strong>Tamesh</strong></a> during the 2021 pandemic. 
                    We were spending so much time on Discord with not much else going on, so we figured we'd learn <strong>Node.js</strong> and create a bot that could tell jokes, display the weather, and even generate images of pets. 
                    This experience built upon my earlier work with Discord bots, including Tamesh's Colorbot, where I first explored basic bot functionality. 
                    LegbotHost expanded on these foundational skills, allowing us to implement more complex features. 
                    It was an awesome learning experience and a good time that helped us improve our coding skills. 
                    Though I did cease to develop the bot sometime in 2022, it was a fantastic learning experience about how to go about developing bots and dealing with real-time APIs.

                <p>
                    During that same time in 2021, Tamesh and I also created Quizziz-Cheat, a small project that taught us the basics of inspect element and how to manipulate code in real time. 
                    Since we frequently had to use <strong>Quizziz</strong> for schoolwork—which was both tedious and time-consuming—we figured, why not automate the process? 
                    This script was written in JavaScript and worked by reading Quizziz's test data and automatically highlighting the correct answers. 
                    Although the project was eventually discontinued and Quizziz patched the exploit, it was a great learning experience in understanding strong>JavaScript strings</strong> and how web pages process data.
