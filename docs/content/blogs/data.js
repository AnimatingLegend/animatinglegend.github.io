            Hello, welcome to my first initial blog post! <br> <br>

            I have made some changes to the ENTIRE WEBSITE. But I mainly got some work on the blog page. 
            The blog posts are now dynamically rendered from a data.js file instead of being hardcoded in the HTML. 
            This allows for easier management and updates to the blog posts without having to modify the HTML directly.
            <br> <br>`,

        hiddenContent: `
            I have also added a "Show More" button that will reveal the hidden content of each blog post when clicked.
            This makes the page cleaner and allows users to focus on the main content first. <br> <br>

            As for the Projects page & Main page, I have made some minor changes to the layout and design.
            The Projects page now has a more organized layout when it comes to code. 
            images are now softcoded and loads up instantly instead of taking 2-3 seconds to load up.
            Theres a lot more I have to when it comes to the projects page, but for now, it is a lot better than before. <br> <br>

            As for the main page, I have made some noticable changes to the layout.
            I removed a lot of the '<strong>' tags within my little about me section so its more readable and less cluttered.
            I also spaced out the text a *tad* bit so its not so cramped up on certain devices (most notably mobile devices).
            I got rid of the contact links, because whats the point of having them when you can just click the icons on the bottom of the page lol.
            And I also make the PDF icon look 'clickable' by adding a hover effect to it. <br> <br>

            A lot was done today, and I am very happy with the results.

            I will continue to work on improving the website and adding more features in the future. Stay tuned! <br> <br>

            Hello, welcome to my first blog post! 
            I'm still trying to work on some backend stuff for this page so I may or may not get some good use out of this page very soon!
            If you take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/AnimatingLegend/animatinglegend.github.io/blob/main/docs/blog.html" class="blog-links" target="_blank"><strong>source code</strong></a>, the way I'm currently writing my blogs is horrendous. <br> <br>`,
        hiddenContent: `
            Later down the weeks, blogs will be written in a different format instead of straight <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>. 
            And the code for this page will undergo massive improvements and better optimization, <strong>frontend & backend</strong>. <br> <br>
            Thanks for reading! <br> <br>
