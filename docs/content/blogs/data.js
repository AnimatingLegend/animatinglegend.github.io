            Hello, welcome to my second blog post! <br> <br>
            I have made some changes to the blog page. The blog posts are now dynamically rendered from a data.js file instead of being hardcoded in the HTML. 
            This allows for easier management and updates to the blog posts without having to modify the HTML directly.
            <br> <br>`,

            I have also added a "Show More" button that will reveal the hidden content of each blog post when clicked.
            This makes the page cleaner and allows users to focus on the main content first. <br> <br>
            I will continue to work on improving the blog page and adding more features in the future. Stay tuned! <br> <br>

            Hello, welcome to my first blog post! 
            I'm still trying to work on some backend stuff for this page so I may or may not get some good use out of this page very soon!
            If you take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/AnimatingLegend/animatinglegend.github.io/blob/main/docs/blog.html" class="blog-links" target="_blank"><strong>source code</strong></a>, the way I'm currently writing my blogs is horrendous. <br> <br>`,
        hiddenContent: `
            Later down the weeks, blogs will be written in a different format instead of straight <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>. 
            And the code for this page will undergo massive improvements and better optimization, <strong>frontend & backend</strong>. <br> <br>
            Thanks for reading! <br> <br>
